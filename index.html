      -[Chantrise] Today I will be reading “Paradise Faces the Bully”, written
      by Anthony S, illustrated by Brandy Williams. Paradise wakes up and looks
      over at the birdcage that is sitting next to her dresser. She gets out of
      bed and walks over to the cage and slowly takes the cover off the top of
      the cage. Being careful not to wake up her pet bird, Paradise checks to
      make sure that she is still sleeping. After Paradise notices that Paris is
      still sleeping, she goes into the bathroom. Every morning Paradise gets
      up, turns on her radio, brushes her teeth, and washes her face. Paradise
      has the cover over the cage so that Paris can sleep peacefully. If she
      doesn’t cover the cage it will be hard for her bird to fall asleep. After
      Paradise washes up and prepares for school, she goes back over to the
      birdcage to see if Paris is still asleep. Paris was wide awake this time,
      so Paradise opens the cage door and reaches inside to get the two small
      pans. One of the pans has water in it. The other small pan has what’s left
      of the bird seeds that Paris had not finished. Paradise is in a good mood;
      she dances in place as she raps to a song that she hears on the radio. She
      continues to sing while filling the small pans. Paris moves her head to
      the sound of the music.
